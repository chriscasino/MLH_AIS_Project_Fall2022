# HootPoopsOnMario

HootPoopsOnMario is a website based game to help young veiwers learn and understand the problems that our enviornment faces and how we can help make our enviornment better. Each chapter has it's own unique plot line which follows the adventure of Mario, Princess Peach, and Rosalina as they travel across many places to reach their home, the Mushroom Kingdom. These classic and well known characters from the beloved games of Nintendo attracts veiwers to see what is next for their favorite mascots. Along with our favorite game characters, we have created a website game to keep young viewers engaged in learning to keep up with the attention of younger audience. 

This game was designed to be user and age friendly to allow young viewers get a head start in learning what is good and bad for the enviornment, the causes and effects of what we add to our enviornement, and what we can and cannot do to help in those situations. With the help our our friendly explainations for each possible answer choice, we envision our pleayer learning something new with each stage. To give players the incentive to play and learn, we have designed a program where for every three stages that the player completes, a tree will be planted in New York. This game, is their opportunity to start making a change in bettering our enviornment by starting today.
